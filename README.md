## 🧠 Signal Generation Process

### 1. **Data Collection**
- Fetch market data for multiple timeframes (5m, 15m, 30m, 1h, 4h, 1d)
- Process and normalize OHLCV data

### 2. **Technical Analysis**
- Calculate key indicators for each timeframe:
  - RSI for momentum
  - MACD for trend changes
  - EMAs for trend direction
  - Bollinger Bands for volatility
  - Support/Resistance for key levels

### 3. **Pattern Recognition**
- Detect candlestick patterns with strength assessment
- Identify high-probability reversal and continuation patterns
- Evaluate pattern context and confirmation

### 4. **Confluence Analysis**
- Determine bias for each timeframe (bullish/bearish/neutral)
- Identify agreement across timeframes
- Calculate overall market direction confidence

### 5. **Signal Decision**
- Generate BUY, SELL, or NO TRADE signal based on confluence
- Assign confidence score (0-100%)
- Provide detailed reasoning for the signal

## 📊 Understanding Signals

### Signal Components
```
Signal: BUY / SELL / NO TRADE
Confidence: 0-100% (recommended minimum: 75%)
Entry Time: Exact candle timestamp for entry (UTC+5:30)
Reason: Detailed analysis of market conditions
Indicators: RSI, MACD, EMA, Volume, Patterns
Timeframe Confluence: Which timeframes confirm the signal
```

### Signal Quality Levels
- **🟢 90%+ Confidence**: Exceptional probability trades
- **🟡 80-89% Confidence**: High probability trades  
- **🟠 70-79% Confidence**: Good probability trades
- **🔴 <70% Confidence**: Exercise caution or avoid trading

### Multi-Timeframe Analysis
The system analyzes 6 different timeframes simultaneously:
- **1d**: Long-term trend context
- **4h**: Medium-term trend direction
- **1h**: Intermediate trend confirmation  
- **30m**: Short-term momentum
- **15m**: Entry timing precision
- **5m**: Execution timing

### Technical Indicators
The system uses a comprehensive set of technical indicators:

```
RSI (14): Momentum oscillator for overbought/oversold conditions
EMA (8, 21, 50): Trend direction and dynamic support/resistance
MACD (12, 26, 9): Trend changes and momentum shifts
Bollinger Bands (20, 2): Volatility and potential reversal zones
Support/Resistance: Key price levels where market may react
Volume Analysis: Confirms price movements and trend strength
ATR (14): Measures market volatility
Stochastic (14, 3, 3): Identifies potential reversal points
Ichimoku Cloud: Complex indicator for trend direction and support/resistance
```

### Candlestick Patterns
The system detects and evaluates the strength of various candlestick patterns:

- **Single Candle Patterns**: Doji, Hammer, Shooting Star, Marubozu
- **Two Candle Patterns**: Engulfing, Harami, Tweezer Tops/Bottoms
- **Three Candle Patterns**: Morning/Evening Star, Three White Soldiers, Three Black Crows

Each pattern is assigned a strength score (0-100%) based on its formation quality and market context.

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables
Create a `.env.local` file in the project root with the following variables:

```
MARKET_DATA_API_KEY=your_twelvedata_api_key
```

### Market Data API
The system uses the TwelveData API for fetching real-time market data. You can:

1. Sign up for a free API key at [TwelveData](https://twelvedata.com/)
2. Add your API key to the `.env.local` file
3. The system will automatically use your API key for fetching data

If no API key is provided, the system will use mock data for demonstration purposes.

## 📈 Performance Tracking

### Signal Performance Metrics
The system tracks various performance metrics:

- **Win Rate**: Percentage of successful signals
- **Average Profit**: Average profit/loss per trade
- **Confidence Accuracy**: Win rate by confidence level
- **Symbol Performance**: Win rate by trading symbol
- **Timeframe Performance**: Win rate by trade duration

### Performance Feedback Loop
The performance tracking system provides feedback to improve future signal generation:

1. **Signal Recording**: Each generated signal is recorded
2. **Outcome Tracking**: Trade outcomes (win/loss) are logged
3. **Analysis**: Performance metrics are calculated
4. **Optimization**: Signal generation parameters are adjusted based on performance

### Data Storage
Signal performance data is stored in JSON format in the `data/signal_performance.json` file. This allows for:

- Persistent storage between application restarts
- Easy backup and analysis of historical performance
- Performance visualization and reporting

## 🛠️ Development Setup

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. Market Data API Issues**
- Check if your API key is valid and has sufficient credits
- Verify your internet connection
- Check the browser console for specific error messages

**2. No Signals Generated**
- Ensure you've selected a valid trading symbol
- Try different trade durations
- Check if the market is currently in a clear trend or consolidation
