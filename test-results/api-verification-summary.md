# TRADAI API Verification Summary

## Overview
This report summarizes the verification of all API keys in the TRADAI system. The verification was conducted to ensure that all API keys are working properly and to identify any issues that need to be addressed.

## API Key Status Summary
- **Total APIs Tested**: 6
- **Working APIs**: 2
- **Failed APIs**: 4

## Detailed Results

### Working APIs

1. **Twelve Data API**
   - Status: ✅ WORKING
   - Status Code: 200
   - This is the primary data source for market data and is functioning correctly.

2. **Groq API**
   - Status: ✅ WORKING
   - Status Code: 200
   - This is used for AI analysis and is functioning correctly.

### Failed APIs

1. **Together AI API**
   - Status: ❌ ERROR
   - Status Code: 401
   - Error: "Invalid API key provided. You can find your API key at https://api.together.xyz/settings/api-keys."
   - **Action Required**: The API key is invalid or expired. A new API key needs to be generated from the Together AI dashboard.

2. **OpenRouter API**
   - Status: ❌ ERROR
   - Status Code: 401
   - Error: "No auth credentials found"
   - **Action Required**: The API key is invalid or not properly formatted. Check the API key format and regenerate if necessary.

3. **Fireworks API**
   - Status: ❌ ERROR
   - Status Code: 404
   - Error: "Model not found, inaccessible, and/or not deployed"
   - **Action Required**: The model specified in the API request ("accounts/fireworks/models/llama-v2-7b") may not be available or the path is incorrect. Check the model availability and update the model path.

4. **DeepInfra API**
   - Status: ❌ ERROR
   - Status Code: 404
   - Error: "Model is not available"
   - **Action Required**: The model specified in the API request ("meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf") may not be available. Check the model availability and update the model path.

## Impact on Workflow Tests

The workflow accuracy tests were successfully completed using the Twelve Data API, which is working correctly. The tests showed that the system is receiving and processing real market data properly, but the analysis logic needs improvement as the accuracy is only slightly better than random chance (54.86%).

The AI analysis components that rely on the failed APIs (Together AI, OpenRouter, Fireworks, DeepInfra) may be falling back to default behavior or simplified analysis, which could explain the pattern detection in the accuracy results.

## Recommendations

1. **Update API Keys**: Generate new API keys for Together AI and OpenRouter to resolve the authentication issues.

2. **Verify Model Availability**: Check the availability of the models specified for Fireworks and DeepInfra, and update the model paths if necessary.

3. **Implement Better Fallbacks**: Enhance the fallback mechanisms when API calls fail to ensure more robust analysis.

4. **Monitor API Usage**: Implement monitoring for API usage and failures to quickly identify and address issues.

5. **Diversify API Providers**: Consider adding redundancy by supporting multiple API providers for each function to reduce dependency on any single provider.

## Conclusion

The primary data source (Twelve Data API) and one AI provider (Groq API) are working correctly, which allows the system to function at a basic level. However, the other AI providers are experiencing issues that need to be addressed to ensure optimal performance of the TRADAI system.

The workflow accuracy tests were successful in terms of API integration, but the analysis logic needs improvement to achieve better-than-random trading performance.
